## About The Project

I wanted to create an all-in-one place for everyone to get to know who I am.  I took inspiration from other portfolio websites then designed and prototyped my own on Canva. I then built the website using the React Library, using feedback from others to improve the user's experience. The design must be a representation of who I am, hence the colour palette. To ensure that all users will have a comfortable experience, I designed the layout to be responsive to any and all screen sizes. This project was a great way for me to practise front-end development, React, and UI/UX design.
